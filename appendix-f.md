Appendix F: Dueling
===================

Stare- and showdowns are really cool. While reading the amazing [We Deal In Lead by Colin Le Sueur](https://byodinsbeardrpg.itch.io/we-deal-in-lead), I noticed the rules for (gun)duels involved (the system's equivalent of) a WIL save, as *"a gunslinger does not kill with their gun but kills with their heart"*. Duels I've ran in the past focused a lot on DEX, as you're either quick or dead, which got me thinking -- what if duels involved all 3 of the attributes?

Dueling Saves
-------------

A duel consist of 3 contests:

1. the **staredown** (WIL),
2. the **draw** (DEX)
3. the **clash** (STR)

During each contest, both individuals make a **Save**. The **winner** gets **advantage (roll 2d20, take the most beneficial result)** on the next **Save**. On a **draw**, no one gets advantage.

- A combatant **wins** if they roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** while the opposing side rolls **above** their **Attribute**.
- If both combatants roll **above** their **Attribute**, it's a **draw**.
- If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute**, the **highest roll** **wins**.
- If both combatants roll **equal or under** their **Attribute** and roll an **equal value**, it's a **draw**.

The Staredown
-------------

The battle of wills. Two opponents lock eyes, their hands hovering over their weapons. Children run to their parents, an eerie wind blows, a lone bird takes flight. A drop of sweat falls on the ground. The **winner** of this clash clearly has ice in their veins. However, in settings where dueling is **illegal**, **losing** the staredown might mean losing your cool, and snarling a death threat at your opponent, meaning your opponent now acts in self-defense.

The Draw
--------

Slow is smooth, and smooth is fast -- but sometimes, slow just means *dead*. Crossbows are leveled, bows aimed, rapiers drawn, swords unsheathed. The **winner** of this contest is just *that* split-second quicker -- and primed to land a devastating blow.

The Clash
---------

Speed is one thing, but landing a blow still requires a certain degree of physical control: a strong follow-through, a decisive slash, a punishing blow. If the duel is done with **ranged weapons**, you could consider leaving this step out -- as the **loser** is likely to make a Critical Damage (STR) Save anyway.

The **winner** of this contest rolls their **damage die** and a **d12** (as their attack is Enhanced), taking the **highest result**. The damage is done directly done to the loser's **STR** (but reduced by any **Armor** worn).

Types of Duels
--------------

Consider any of the following dueling rulesets, depending on your setting:

- **Friendly Duel**. Do not roll **damage** after the **Clash** -- simply keep track of who *could've* landed a serious blow.
- **To The Death**. After the **Clash**, both parties roll for initiative as per normal combat, and duke it out.
- **3 Touches**. After the **Clash**,  combatants are expected to retake their position and duel again, until one side scores 3 hits. Depending on whether the duel is friendly or not, this could be simply for points, or a case of  "the aim is to get 3 points, and not die".
- **The Dramatic Climax.** Use a 'best out of 3' structure. Damage is only done after one combatant wins the decisive clash -- the duels leading up to it represent a dramatic clashing of blades, moments to spout dramatic exposition or vengeful monologues.
