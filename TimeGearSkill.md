# Time, Gear & Skill
Performing actions involves time, gear, and skill.
- Generally, if you have none or one of the three, a task is impossible.
- If you have all three, you do not need to roll - it just succeeds.
- If you only have two, the task might involve a Save, with time or your gear at stake if you fail.

## Optional Rule: Attributes
Attributes only play a role in determining Saves. As an optional rule, we can interpret ability scores as descriptors of Player Characters, and as possible substitutes for gear or skill:

|Attribute|Value|Effect|
|:---|:---|:---|
|STR|6 or lower|Weak – Tasks requiring average strength might be more difficult.|
|STR|15 or higher|Strong – Brawn can sometimes substitute skill or gear.|
|DEX|6 or lower|Clumsy – Tasks requiring average dexterity might be more difficult.|
|DEX|15 or higher|Deft – Nimbleness and agility can sometimes substitute skill or gear.|
|WIL|6 or lower|Feebleminded – A -1 modifier on reaction rolls.|
|WIL|15 or higher|Strong-willed – A +1 modifier on reaction rolls.|
