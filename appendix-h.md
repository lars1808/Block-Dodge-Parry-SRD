Appendix H: Survivability
=========================

Attacks always hit. However, players have quite a few options to postpone their untimely demise. These options can be sorted into 2 types: **player survivability** and **mechanical survivability**. It's a good idea to share these concepts with your players! Each layer of survivability 'stacks' upon the next; the subsequent 'layer' is a fallback, if the one above it fails.

Player Survivability
--------------------

- **Strategy** prevents the need for tactics; kill your enemies before they know what hit them! Why storm the house if you can set it on fire? Why fight in a pitched battle against a squad of bandits if you can collapse the ravine walls?

- **Tactics** prevent you from getting hit. Positioning, cover, high ground -- everything that takes place within combat, and stacks the deck in your favor.

Mechanical Survivability
------------------------

- **Fatigue** allows you to block, dodge and parry. It can prevent and minimize damage. It also ties into your **inventory management**.

- **Inventory** and what you carry: you can sacrifice gear to prevent damage.

- **Skills** allow for damage reduction and -prevention, such as *Scrap Fighter*.

- **Armor** works as a flat damage reduction, if you really run out of options to prevent incoming damage.

- **HP** protects your STR, and symbolizes your general ability to protect yourself. It can be increased by training.

- **STR** is your last line of defense. If you fail a Critical Damage Save, or if your STR reaches 0, you die.
