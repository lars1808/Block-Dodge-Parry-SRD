Appendix E: Finding A Trainer
=============================

*Block, Dodge, Parry* has a big emphasis on **skills**, and **skills** require **trainers** to be taught!

Instead of "You have reached level X, and now (somehow) know [Level X benefits here]", the discovery (and convincing!) of new trainers should be a fun adventure in and of itself. Use these tables for ideas!

So, you've heard of a sword technique only taught in the Bronze City of Japar, you've obtained a lockbox with a twin-linked copper-cased lock and don't know how to pick it, you want to master the concept of *Read* to use in *Practical Magic* or you want to master the element of *Ice*. What now?
