The following list serves 2 purposes:

**At Character Creation**, choose **up to 4 previous careers**. Choosing a career means you spend at least *some* time in this capacity - maybe it was your actual job, maybe a side gig, maybe a personal interest. You can **choose a career multiple times**. Every time you pick a career, you can choose a single **skill** from this career and add it to your character.

See _Appendix G: Age & Experience_ for options to have a character's age affect their careers and attributes.

Secondarily, these skills can be **acquired later on,** by searching out a skilled individual and receiving training.

Learning New Skills
-------------------

New skills can be acquired in **3 ways**:

### By Doing

The Warden is encouraged to award new skills organically if the players show consistent dedication to learning them.

### By Training

Training requires a **trainer** in the mentioned **career**. If you want to learn how to pick a lock, go find a thief - simple as that. Hiring a trainer will cost about 50 gold per week -- though often, trainers will want other incentives than just gold in order to train you. See _Appendix E: Finding A Trainer_ for more ideas!

### By Studying

Proper treatises and manuals will **seem more expensive and difficult** than hiring a trainer, but the benefit is that once purchased, others can follow the training as well. A book that can teach you a skill should cost about twice as much as the estimated cost for training; if a skill takes 3 weeks to learn for 50 gold per week, a book teaching the same skill would cost 300 gold. Training from a book will also take about 50% longer as studying under a trainer.

### Skill Difficulty

The Warden will determine how hard the new skill is to learn. Learning a new skill always costs Time. If hiring a trainer or purchasing a manual, it also costs Gold.

Generally, easy skills take about 1 week to learn, and more complex skills 6 weeks or more.

### Various Mechanics for Training

There are various ways to implement the actual training:

- Training only takes the predetermined amount of weeks. After x weeks, the PC is guaranteed to have learned the skill.
- Use the number of weeks as a tracker for advancement. At the end of a week of training, make a WIL Save. On a success, mark 1 progression. *Example: a Skill that would take 3 weeks to learn, requires 3 succesful WIL Saves, each after a week of training.*

If you'd rather keep Saves as Saves and not as skill checks, consider using a 2d6 roll after each week of training.

- On a 6 or less, you do not progress in your training.
- On a 7-9, you make 1 step of progress.
- On a 10+, you make 1 step of progress, and treat the next 2d6 roll as an automatic step of progress as well.
- This also allows for implementation of *modifiers*. If the skill you're trying to learn is unlike anything you've done before, gain a -1 on your roll. If your trainer is particularly skilled, gain +1 or even +2. The Warden is encouraged to come up with further relevant negative and positive modifiers!

### Skills & NPCs

The skills described below are meant as a way to kickstart your imagination. They should act as prompts - they are not meant as an extensive be-all, end-all list.

NPCs might have the skills mentioned - in fact, players are encouraged to search for NPCs that can help them accomplish their goals - but I'd urge to not build NPCs as strictly possessing certain skills.

A dreaded evil knight can be spiced up by determining beforehand that they are a Momentum Master, but don't pre-define every skill.

To illustrate: If the players are stumped by a lock on an ancient stone door somewhere in the city sewers, this should motivate them to find someone who can pick locks. Thieves can be assumed to have this skill, so if the players invest proper time and effort to find a skilled thief, it'd be a good reward to have that thief be a lockpicker. The thief might require the service of the players first, of course.

When in doubt as to whether a certain NPC can provide a certain skill, you can always roll the die of fate - a simple d6, with higher rolls signaling a more favorable outcome.

The skill list should mostly be a reference to give rulings on events that happen naturally within the world - not a strict manual of what those inhabiting that world can and cannot do.

Gaining More HP
---------------

Anyone with notably more combat experience than a PC can give **general combat training**.

- Regular soldiers, sellswords, and similar folk can give *basic combat training* which takes 1 week and costs 50 gold, after which the PC can roll **1d6** for their new HP. If the roll is lower than your current HP, ignore the roll and increase your max HP by 1.

- Veterans and expert trainers can give *advanced combat training* which takes 4 weeks and costs 75 gold per week, after which the PC can roll **2d6** for their new HP. If the roll is lower than your current HP, ignore the roll and increase your max HP by 1. Taking this training requires a base HP of 6.

- Legendary heroes and champions can give training that allows the PC to roll **3d6** for their new HP. If the roll is lower than your current HP, ignore the roll and increase your max HP by 1. Taking this training requires a base HP of 9.

Increasing Your Attributes
--------------------------

A PC can increase their **Attributes** through **training**. This training costs **200 gold per week**. At the end of the week, roll a D20. If you roll above your current Attribute, it increases by 1. An attribute cannot be raised above 18.

- **Strength Training** can be given by physically strong trainers, such as sailors, blacksmiths, soldiers, but also dwarves and giants.

- **Dexterity Training** can be given by thieves, assassins, hunters but also elves and the like.

- **Willpower Training** can be given by magic-users, priests, or similar folk.
