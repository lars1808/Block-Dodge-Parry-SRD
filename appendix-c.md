Appendix C: Practical Magic Tags
================================

When using this system, players can learn new tags while adventuring. Remember to keep the guidelines of *Practical Magic* in mind. The actual effect of the spell depends on the number of MD invested, ranging from "Can be achieved with tools instead of magic" to "Mythical".

**Adapt**

- Acts as a warm coat in cold weather

- Allows you to breathe underwater

- Creates an arcane cocoon, granting the person inside invulnerability to everything outside (but also prohibiting any form of interaction)

**Charm**

- The target acts as if you've bought them a drink

- The target suddenly vaguely remembers you as a long-lost friends

- Completely overwrites any negative impression the target might have of you

**Cloak**

- Summons a pile of dead leaves to dive into

- You become a shimmer; a suggestion of a shape

- You become virtually invisible.

**Detect**

- Allows you to focus on your surroundings, as if you're using a magnifying glass or set of binoculars

- Allows you to vaguely detect the aura of nearby beings

- You can pinpoint every being in a city-block radius

**Dispel**

- As if you prod and poke at a ward with a stick, pliers or rock salt. Like throwing a pebble on a landmine.

- Completely dissect a complicated ward or curse.

- Fundamentally undo time-travel and other reality-warping magic.

**Fly**

- Like using a really big sheet to slow your fall.

- Controlled hovering, slight upwards motion.

- Sprouting wings or transforming into a flying creature.

**Haste**

- Like drinking an invigorating beverage, shaking off the effects of exhaustion for a while.

- Greatly increased agility and speed, running for an hour without fatigue, things take half as long as they normally would.

- Time briefly loses its grip on you; it's as if you manifest effect without perceivable cause.

**Knock**

- Causes an unlocked door to swing open, a lock to click and rattle until it is unlocked

- A heavy stone door is thrown open, a lock crumples into dust

- Castle gates are blasted open, all locks nearby cease to exist

**Light**

- A good alternative for a torch.

- A handy, supernatural hovering light.

- As if you've summoned the sun.

**Move**

- Prodding or pulling small objects nearby, as if affected by an invisible 10ft. pole with a hook.

- Effortlessly move an object with your mind, up to human-sized to a Far range.

- As if you have manifested an invisible tornado.

**Protect**

- Impair a specific type of damage towards yourself.

- Protect your party from a certain element, *Impairing* it.

- Completely dispel a lingering hazard, such as poison or a dark aura.

**Read**

- Just like keeping a common dictionary handy

- Like a mental tome of long-lost languages

- You can read anything; expressions, lies, language, feelings

**Send Message**

- Like sending a letter; it takes a while, and might get lost.

- Instant mental communication between a small group of individuals over a short range.

- Directly implant your thoughts into the mind of another being, anywhere.
