> The main version of Block, Dodge, Parry is currently in [release 2.0](https://dicegoblin.blog/out-now-block-dodge-parry-v2-0/). This SRD still reflects version 1.32, and will be updated - in time. My primary focus is perfecting and supporting the full release. Curious? Check it out on [itch.io](https://dicegoblingames.itch.io/block-dodge-parry) and [DriveThruRPG](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/425888/Block-Dodge-Parry--A-Levelless-Classless-Expansion-of-Cairn)!

# Rules
## Abilities
Each of the three **abilities** is used in different circumstances.
- **Strength (STR)**: Used for saves requiring physical power, like lifting gates, bending bars, resisting poison, etc.
- **Dexterity (DEX)**: Used for saves requiring poise, speed, and reflexes like dodging, climbing, sneaking, balancing, etc. 
- **Willpower (WIL)**: Used for saves to persuade, deceive, interrogate, intimidate, charm, provoke, manipulate spells, etc.

## Saves
A save is a roll to avoid bad outcomes from risky choices and circumstances. 

PCs roll a d20. If they **roll equal to or lower than** the ability score, they pass. Otherwise, they fail.

## Healing
### Short Rests
Resting for a few moments and having a drink of water restores lost HP but leaves the party exposed.

### Long Rests & Sleep
Staying awake all night leaves you **Deprived**; sleeping grants benefits, depending on the level of comfort:

|Type of rest|Example|Effect|
|:----|:---------|:----|
|None|Traveling studying or exploring all night|Deprived|
|Perilous|A fortified room in a dungeon, a makeshift camp in a blizzard|Not Deprived|
|Normal|Well-made camp in the wilderness, a simple inn|Not Deprived, removes all Fatigue|
|Comfortable|A luxurious chamber, next to a magical fey spring|Not Deprived, removes all Fatigue, restore Ability Loss by 1d6|

## Ability Score Loss
Ability loss (see Critical Damage) can usually be restored with a week’s rest facilitated by a healer or other appropriate source of care and expertise. Some of these services are free, while magical or more expedient means of recovery may come at a cost.

## Deprivation & Fatigue
A PC **deprived** of a crucial need (such as food or rest) is **unable to recover HP or ability scores**. Anyone deprived for more than a day adds **Fatigue** to their inventory, one for each day. Each Fatigue occupies **one slot** and lasts until they can recuperate (such as a full night’s rest in a safe spot). PCs can also gain Fatigue by blocking and dodging, casting spells, or through events in the fiction.

## Armor
Before calculating damage to HP, subtract the target’s **Armor** value from the result of damage rolls. Shields and similar armor provide a bonus defense (e.g. +1 Armor), but only while the item is held or worn. No one can have more than 3 Armor.
Shields, gauntlets, and helms may provide additional benefits according to their use.

## Morale
Enemies must pass a **WIL save** to avoid fleeing when they take their first casualty and again when they lose half their number. Some groups may use their leader’s WIL in place of their own. Lone foes must save when they’re reduced to 0 HP. Morale does not affect PCs.

## Reactions
When the PCs encounter an NPC whose reaction to the party is not obvious, the Warden may roll 2d6 and consult the following table:

|2d6|Result|
|:---|:---|
|2|Hostile|
|3-5|Wary|
|6-8|Curious|
|9-11|Kind|
|12|Helpful|

## Wealth & Treasure
The most common coin is the gold piece (gp), which is equal to 10 silver pieces (sp) and 100 copper pieces (cp).

Treasure is highly valuable, usually bulky, and rarely useful beyond its value. It can be a lure, taking PCs to exotic and even dangerous locations, and is often under the protection of intimidating foes.

Villages, strongholds, and ports of call barter and trade based on the local rarity and value of an item or commodity.
