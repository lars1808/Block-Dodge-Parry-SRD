Appendix G: Age & Experience
============================

When making a character, you can pick up to 4 different careers, and pick 4 corresponding skills. The following are optional rules to provide for a larger arc in personal growth, and the effects age might have on a character.

Age & Experience
----------------

|1d6|Age & Experience|Effect on STR|Effect on DEX|Effect on WIL|
|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
|1|Young: barely not a teenager anymore. You can pick 1 Career Skill.|-1|+2|-2|
|2|Emerging: you’re starting to learn the ropes. Roll 2d4, and keep the lowest value; that’s your number of Career Skills.|0|+1|-1|
|3-4|Prime: you’re in your prime. Roll 1d4: that’s your number of Career Skills.|+1|0|0|
|5|Wizened: you’re getting up there. Roll 2d4, and keep the highest value; that’s your number of Career Skills.|0|-1|+1|
|6|Old: you’ve been around. You can pick 4 Career Skills.|-1|-2|+2|

Rolling for Age
---------------

Roll **1d6** to determine the starting age.

Optional: Effect on Attributes
------------------------------

The grey-highlighted part of the table offers an optional addition. Without it, being older is purely a benefit. If you use the modifiers mentioned, it will have the following effects:

- **Strength** is at one's peak during their physical prime.

- **Dexterity** lessens over time, as one gets older and more stiff.

- **Willpower** increases, as the mind fortifies itself over a long life.
