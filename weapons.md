# Weapons
## Weapon Types
Weapons can deal 3 types of damage:

- **Piercing**. Rolling the maximum value on your damage roll makes your attack ignore all armor. This ability only works if you use the regular damage die for the weapon (i.e., not on an Impaired d4 attack, for example.)
- **Bludgeoning**. Always ignores 1 armor.
- **Slashing**. Deals +1 damage against targets without armor.

Weapons take up **1 inventory slot** unless marked as **Bulky**, which means they also require two hands to wield.

Weapons can be **fast**, **balanced** or **slow**:

-	**Fast**. These weapons strike fast but do not do a lot of damage. They all share a **d6 damage dice**. 
-	**Balanced**. These weapons are well-balanced between speed and weight. They all share a **d8 damage dice**.
-	**Slow**. These weapons are somewhat slower but pack a punch. They all share a **d10 damage dice**.

## Weapon Skills

-	**Heavy X:** Ignore X points of ARMOR, but DAMAGE rolls of X or lower completely miss.
-	**Sweep X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or higher grant one bonus attack on another target in reach. You can’t chain this effect for multiple bonus attacks.
-	**Reach X:** When charged with a weapon shorter than yours when fighting back, the attacker must roll X or higher on their DAMAGE roll or else you get to attack them first. Weapons with Reach also allow you to attack before weapons that would usually be quicker in a _clash_.
-	**Counter X:** DAMAGE rolls of X or less against you are bounced back against your attacker.
-	**Brutal X:** CRITICAL DAMAGE resulting from a DAMAGE roll of X or more from this weapon is an instant kill, and forces a morale SAVE on the enemy.
-	**Shock X:** Damage rolls of X or higher trigger a STR Save - on a failure, the target loses its next turn.
-	**Bleed X:** On a damage roll of X or higher, the target takes an additional 1d4 STR damage at the start of their next turn. This STR damage does not incur a Critical Damage save.

## Magic Weapons
Legends speak of magic weapons; forged by dwarves, enchanted by elves, cursed by demons. These weapons might have the following properties:
-	Eversharp X: Reroll damage rolls of X or lower.
-	Magic X: Add X to any damage roll, without exceeding the maximum possible damage for this weapon.

## Learning How To Use A Weapon
Weapons require training to be used effectively.

### Damage Type Proficiency
To use a weapon’s **Damage Type** effects, such as bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing, you need to make **5 killing blows** in lethal combat with any weapon of that type.

When making a character, you can choose one Damage Type to be already proficient in.

### Weapon Skill Proficiency
To use the weapon tag (**Brutal**, **Sweep**, etc.) of an individual weapon, you need to make **5 killing blows** in lethal combat with that specific weapon.

When picking up a different weapon with the same tag (i.e., a Longsword and Scimitar both have Sweep), you’ll still need to gain Weapon Skill Proficiency.

## Breaking Point

When the chips are down, you can sacrifice your equipment. Performing an offensive or defensive action requires either desperation or complete dedication. You either need to **be at 0 HP** already, or choose to lower your defense and **'drop' to 0 HP voluntarily**.

- **Offensive**: Sacrifice your **weapon** to **Enhance** your attack. Your weapon is broken afterwards - useless unless repaired. Repairing costs are 75% of new cost. This can be done with all weapon types.

- **Defensive**: Sacrifice your **weapon**, **shield** or **Armor** to **ignore** an incoming blow. This destroys the equipment - useless unless repaired. Repairing costs are 75% of new cost, but shields are always broken when sacrificed and cannot be repaired. **Mundane attacks** (weapons, claws, teeth etc.) can be stopped with **balanced-** and **heavy weapons, shields,** and **light (+1)** and **heavy armor (+2)**. **Special attacks** (magic, elemental energy etc.) can only be stopped with **heavy armor (+2)** and **shields**.
